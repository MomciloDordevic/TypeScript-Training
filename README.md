A simple Drag and Drop project done with TypeScript.

The purpose of this project is for me to get more confortable with TypeScript so that I can futher implement it in React.js and Vue.js

The project consists of a page that has a form in which you can add various tasks.

When submited, you can chose to place the task into two different segments, completed and non completed.

WebPack has been used in this project for development tools and a development server to monitor changes and progress.
